    "## Binary encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "As ten-fingered humans, we naturally gravitate towards base-ten units, which is evident in our currency and scientific measurements (though, interestingly, not in timekeeping). Early computational devices, such as abacuses with rows of ten beads, followed this trend. The first mechanical computers, like the Difference Engine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine), also employed ten-position dials. While these devices were somewhat effective, they lacked scalability due to the engineering challenge of creating precise dials. Manufacturing faults could lead to errors that propagated throughout the system, negatively impacting computational outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the late 1930s, most computers transitioned to binary encoding, utilizing sequences of '0's and '1's to represent information. The primary advantage of binary encoding is that bits, the fundamental computational units, correspond to the on/off states of switches. Switches are among the simplest mechanical systems to engineer, making binary computers highly resilient to errors. Consequently, the majority of contemporary computing systems are built on binary logic."

    "In binary representation, numbers are expressed using only two digits: $0$ and $1$. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of $2$, starting from the right with $2^0$, then moving to the left with $2^1$, $2^2$, and so on. To convert a decimal number to binary, we can represent it as a sum of powers of $2$, using only the digits $0$ and $1$.\n",
