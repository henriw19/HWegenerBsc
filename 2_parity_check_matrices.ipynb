    "The ultimate goal of this set of tutorials is to teach you how to design and simulate *qoantum* error correction codes. In the last sentence, you may have noticed that the word \"quantum\" was misspelled as \"qoantum.\" However, you were still able to understand the meaning of the sentence. This is an example of the error correction that is inherent in spoken and written communication in languages such as English and German.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's explore how we, as humans, decode the corrupted word \"qoantum\" and correct it to \"quantum.\" In school, we learned that in most Latin-derived languages, a \"Q\" is always followed by a \"U\" in valid words. This rule, or correlation, is stored in some portion of our brains. When we see a word containing a \"Q,\" we check this rule to see whether it is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the received word \"qoantum,\" we see that the rule is violated, and we can immediately see a correction for the corrupted word: namely, that the second letter \"O\" should be swapped out for a \"U.\" This idea of storing and checking the veracity of correlations is the essential concept that underpins all error correction.

    "## Parity checks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the English language, we have an alphabet containing 26 distinct characters. Fortunately, when constructing binary linear error correction codes, the alphabet is much simpler, containing only two distinct symbols: \"0\" and \"1\". In this context, all correlations we establish and check for error corrections involve a so-called parity check. A parity check is a mod2 sum over a list of bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bit-string with three symbols, $\\mathbf{b} = b_0b_1b_2$. In this case, the parity of the bit string is given by $p = (b_0+b_1+b_2) \\mod 2$. We can also compute the parity of a subset of the string, such as $p_{0,1} = (b_0+b_1) \\mod 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parity checks play a crucial role in detecting and correcting errors in data transmission and storage systems, ensuring the integrity of information. By examining the parity of a bit string or a subset thereof, it is possible to identify whether an error has occurred, allowing for efficient error detection and correction."

    "## Repetition Codes and Parity Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we discussed how a repetition code encoding can be understood as a simple duplication of bits in the original encoding. Now, we will demonstrate how repetition codes can be represented using a parity checking formalism. Let's start by considering a three-bit repetition code, where raw bits are mapped to codewords as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0\\rightarrow 000$$\n",
    "$$1\\rightarrow 111$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One immediate observation is that consecutive bits in the encoding have the same value. We can represent this observation using a series of parity checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_0 = (b_0 + b_1) \\mod 2 = 0$$\n",
    "$$p_1 = (b_1 + b_2) \\mod 2 = 0$$\n",
    "$$p_2 = (b_2 + b_0) \\mod 2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that all of the above sums are performed \"mod 2\". Now, let's suppose we receive a corrupted codeword \"010\". In this situation, we observe that both $p_0$ and $p_1$ do not equal zero: $p_0 = (0 + 1) \\mod 2 = 1$ and $p_1 = (1 + 0) \\mod 2 = 1$. This information indicates that the codeword is corrupted, and we need to perform some form of correction.\n",

    "## Parity-check Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we wrote down three parity checks for the repetition code encoding. As these parity checks are linear equations with overlapping constraints, it makes sense to represent them as a single matrix equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\left(\\begin{matrix}1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{b}$ is a repetition code codeword, either $000$ or $111$. From the above, it is clear that all information we need to know about the parity checks is contained within the matrix $H$. We call this the **parity check matrix**. Each column of the parity check matrix corresponds to bits $0$ to $n-1$ of the codeword, where $n$ is the length of the codeword. Each row of the parity check matrix corresponds to a parity check, with the non-zero positions marking out the bits (columns) involved in the check.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Syndrome Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The parity check matrix is defined such that it maps valid codewords to a zero-vector known as the zero-syndrome, $\\mathbf{s_0}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{s_0} = H\\cdot \\mathbf{c} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{c}$ is a codeword of the error correction code defined by the parity checks of $H$. Now, consider the case where the codeword is corrupted by an error $\\mathbf{e}$. In this scenario, the received vector is given by $\\mathbf{c}+\\mathbf{e}$ (i.e., the original codeword plus the error). Now multiplying this by the parity check matrix, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H \\cdot (\\mathbf{c}+\\mathbf{e}) = \\mathbf{s}_0 + \\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{s}$ is referred to as the **code syndrome**. As $\\mathbf{s}_0$ is simply the zero vector, the above equation can be simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H \\cdot \\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the above as the **syndrome equation** for the code $H$.\n",

    "Let's now return to the example of the three-bit repetition code. We see that $H\\cdot \\mathbf{c} = 0$ for both $\\mathbf{c} = 000$ and $\\mathbf{c} = 111$. However, we get non-zero syndromes when the parity check matrix is applied to non-codewords. Eg. consider the $\\mathbf{e} = 100$, here we get the non-zero syndrome $s = H\\cdot[1,0,0]^T = [1,0,1]^T$. The table below shows the syndromes for all error permutations:\n",

But what happens if the error is $\\mathbf{e} = 111$ (i.e., equal to one of the codewords)? In this case, we get the zero syndrome, meaning we are left non-the-wiser as to whether anything is wrong. We call undetectable errors of this type **logical errors**. The code distance is the minimum Hamming weight of a non-zero bitstring that maps to a zero syndrome under the action of $H$. In other words, it is the minimum weight of a codeword. For the three-bit repetition code example, the $111$ is the minimum-weight codeword, so the distance of the code is $d=3$.\n",
