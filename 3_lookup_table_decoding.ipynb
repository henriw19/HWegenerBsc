    "# Lookup-table decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we learnt how error correction protocols can be defined through the parity check matrix formalism. The parity check matrix defines a series of constraints that can be tested to obtain a *code syndrome*. The code syndrome can then be *decoded* to obtain a suitable recovery operation. More succicently, the aim of the decoder is to find to obtain the most probable bitstring $\\mathbf{\\tilde{e}}$ consistent with the measured syndrome:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\tilde{e}} = {\\rm ARGMAX}_\\mathbf{e}(P(\\mathbf{e}|\\mathbf{s}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy ...  but incredibly inneficient ... decoding method is to make a lookup table that enumerates over all syndromes. This brute-force approach involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a syndrome table for all $2^n$ combinations of errors, where $n$ is the length of the code.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary (or equivalent data-structure) that maps each syndrome to the lowest weight error that could generate it under the action of the parity check matrix H."

    "## Monte-Carlo Decoding Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "A Monte-Carlo Decoding (MCD) simulation is a numerical technique for testing the performance of a code under a given noise model. The essential simulation procedure is summarised below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly generate an error $\\mathbf{e}$ according to the chosen error model parameterised by some physical error rate $p$.\n",
    "- Measure the syndrome $\\mathbf{s} = H \\cdot \\mathbf{e}$\n",
    "- Decode the syndrome to obtain a recovery vector $\\mathbf{r}$.\n",
    "- If $\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{e} = 0$, then the decoding is a success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the above decoding procedure multiple times allows a *logical error rate* $p_L$ to be computed. This can be compared against the physical error rate $p$ to determine whether the error correction procedure is usefully supressing the error rate."
