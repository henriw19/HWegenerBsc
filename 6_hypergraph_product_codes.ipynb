    "$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix}0&H_Z\\\\H_X&0\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $H_X$ and $H_Z$ represent classical codes designed to detect phase-flips and bit-flips respectively. However, the task isn't as straightforward as choosing our two favourite codes for $H_X$ and $H_Z$. This is because of the necessity for stabilizers to commute, which implies that the product of $H_X$ and the transpose of $H_Z$ must equal zero, ie. $H_X\\cdot H_Z^T=0$. This property imposes restrictions on the selection of $H_X$ and $H_Z$, making the design of quantum codes a challenging task."

    "Designing quantum codes is challenging, largely due to the need for stabilizers to commute, i.e., $H_X\\cdot H_Z^T=0$. One practical approach to find such sets of stabilizers is using a method called *product construction*. This can be envisaged as a procedural blueprint that transforms classical codes into commuting sets of stabilizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll look at a specific form of product construction, called the *hypergraph* product. This concept, first introduced by [[Tillich & Zemor 2014]](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0566), works with any classical matrix $H$ (referred to as the 'seed'). It allows us to create a quantum CSS code by defining the $H_X$ and $H_Z$ components as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_X = \\begin{bmatrix} H \\otimes I_n, I_m \\otimes H^T \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "$$H_Z = \\begin{bmatrix} I_n \\otimes H, H^T \\otimes I_m \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $m$ and $n$ are the number of rows and columns in the seed parity check matrix $H$, respectively. The advantage of the hypergraph product lies in its ability to guarantee commuting stabilizers, regardless of the form of $H$. This makes it a useful tool in quantum code design."
